# Phase 2 pipeline design

Phase 2 (port pipeline logic into Dagster assets — see
[breakdown.md](breakdown.md)) is explicitly the deepest, most
architecturally significant phase of this epic. Partitioning, storage,
deletion, and automation semantics for the enrichment stage are now
decided (see sections below and [Decisions made so far](#decisions-made-so-far));
the only thing still genuinely open is the LlamaIndex/LangChain framework
choice (see [Frameworks under consideration](#frameworks-under-consideration)).
Captured here so decisions and their reasoning aren't lost, and future
changes get worked through deliberately rather than relitigated ad hoc.

**Collaboration model for this phase:** pipeline architecture is a joint
call, not something to design and implement unilaterally. Surface options,
tradeoffs, and a recommendation; the final choice on asset boundaries,
partitioning, frameworks, and storage is a senior/human decision. Don't
scaffold assets or lock in a framework choice ahead of that discussion.

## Partitioning — decided (2026-07-05)

**Dynamic partitions keyed by `imdb_id`**, applied to three new assets:
`synopsis`, `enrichment`, and `embeddings`. Each asset's partition
function generates/writes all the data for that movie in one go
(`enrichment` still runs all 3 sections — craft/meaning/context —
internally per partition, keeping the section-level skip-check from the
legacy code for partial-completion resumption within a movie). A fourth,
final asset, `qdrant_collection`, is deliberately **unpartitioned** — see
[Asset boundary](#asset-boundary--decided-2026-07-05) below for why.

Partitioning exists specifically because *fetching* the underlying content
is expensive (scraping, LLM generation, embedding calls) — it is not
applied to the Qdrant write itself, which is cheap to redo in full once
the expensive data already exists on disk.

Cardinality (~156 partitions today) was raised as a possible concern but
dismissed: comparable to a single year of daily time-partitioned assets
elsewhere, well within normal Dagster scale.

Rejected alternatives:
- **No partitioning** — not viable. Rejected because it would force a
  fresh full re-fetch/re-generate of all expensive LLM calls on every run;
  there'd be no way to skip movies already processed at the Dagster level.
- **Multi-dimensional partitions (`imdb_id` × `section`, ~468 partitions)**
  — the per-section skip-check inside `enrichment` already gives
  equivalent granularity without fragmenting the partition grid 3x for
  little added benefit at this library size.
- **Static batch partitions (chunks of N movies)** — no meaningful
  boundary at 156 movies; loses "redo exactly the one that failed" for no
  real savings over per-movie partitions.

### Why not just re-derive completion from Qdrant, like the legacy code did

The legacy `enrichment.py` queried Qdrant directly ("does an enriched
point for this imdb_id+section already exist?") to decide what to skip —
completion state lived entirely in the sink, re-derived every run. Moving
to Dagster-native dynamic partitions makes that state visible in the
Dagster UI (per-movie materialization history, targeted backfill of just
the failed movies) instead of being opaque outside the orchestrator.

## Intended parallelism and rate limiting — decided (2026-07-05)

Partitions of `synopsis`/`enrichment`/`embeddings` should be allowed to
run **in parallel** where possible (not forced serial) — real throughput
control over the external rate limits (Gemini for enrichment, politeness
delays for scraping) is via **Dagster concurrency pools**: tag each asset
with a pool (e.g. `pool="gemini_llm"` on `enrichment`, `pool="imdb_scrape"`
on `synopsis`) and cap `max_concurrent` for that pool instance-wide. The
legacy in-process retry/backoff on 429/RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED/timeout is kept
regardless — pools throttle concurrency, backoff handles the actual
rate-limit signal when it happens anyway. Exact pool configuration surface
(instance YAML vs. UI) to be confirmed against current Dagster docs at
implementation time — not covered by the `dagster-expert` skill's current
reference set. `qdrant_collection` (unpartitioned) needs no pool — Qdrant
is a real client-server DB, not rate-limited the way Gemini is.

## Idempotency and backfill semantics — decided (2026-07-05)

The automation condition differs by stage, split along **cost**: stages
where refetching is expensive/rate-limited get manual-only regeneration;
stages that just derive from already-fetched data get automatic
consistency tracking, because letting a derived value go stale relative
to its source is a correctness bug, and re-deriving it is cheap.

- **`synopsis`** — no `automation_condition`; the `sync_imdb_id_partitions`
  sensor is its sole trigger (see [Known gaps](#known-gaps-found-during-dev-subset-verification-2026-07-05)
  item 2 — `AutomationCondition.on_missing()` was originally used here but
  replaced after a cold-start bug was found in it). Never reprocessed once
  it has any materialization; scraping is the entry point and isn't free.
  Redo only via explicit backfill.
- **`enrichment`** — same: no `automation_condition`, sensor-triggered
  relative to `synopsis`'s on-disk presence. This is the one that matters
  most: a `synopsis` backfill must **not** silently cascade into fresh,
  paid Gemini calls. `eager()` was considered and rejected here
  specifically because its cascade behavior (re-running `synopsis` would
  automatically re-trigger `enrichment` too, since it'd see its upstream
  dependency change) makes the expensive stage fire as a side effect of an
  unrelated backfill — never acceptable for a rate-limited, paid API.
- **`embeddings`** — `AutomationCondition.eager()` relative to
  `enrichment`. Embedding a text is a single, comparatively cheap API
  call — but if `enrichment` changes (via normal fill-in *or* an explicit
  backfill) and `embeddings` doesn't follow automatically, you get exactly
  the failure mode being protected against: a vector in Qdrant that no
  longer matches the text it's supposed to represent. Consistency here is
  mandatory, and cheap to maintain automatically.
- **`qdrant_collection`** — `AutomationCondition.eager()` relative to
  `embeddings` (unpartitioned — see [Asset boundary](#asset-boundary--decided-2026-07-05)).
  Same reasoning as `embeddings`: the final consumer must never be allowed
  to drift from whatever `embeddings` currently holds.

**Consequence:** a deliberate, expensive redo (bug fixes, prompt/model
changes) only ever requires an **explicit backfill of `synopsis` and/or
`enrichment`** for the affected movie(s) — `embeddings` and
`qdrant_collection` automatically and correctly follow from there with no
additional manual step, and no risk of a mismatched vector being served.

## Deletion / pruning cascade — decided (2026-07-05)

The legacy `sync_library()` (`app/main.py:34-56`) diffed Plex's current
imdb_ids against previously-known ones, deleted removed rows from SQLite,
then deleted the corresponding Qdrant points via a `metadata.imdb_id`
filter (`_sync_removals_to_vector_store`). Because `qdrant_collection` is
now a full delete-and-reinsert rebuild rather than incremental per-movie
upserts (see below), **no Qdrant-specific deletion logic is needed at
all** — removal reduces entirely to file cleanup:

A sensor triggered off `raw_movies`/`stg_movies` materialization diffs the
current run's imdb_ids against the **registered dynamic partition set**
(not against "did stg_movies re-run" — a routine full-refresh of 156
already-known movies must not look like new data). For each imdb_id:
- **New** → `add_dynamic_partitions`. `on_missing()`/`eager()` then fill in
  `synopsis` → `enrichment` → `embeddings` for it, per the conditions above.
- **Removed** (no longer in Plex) → `delete_dynamic_partition` (shared
  across `synopsis`/`enrichment`/`embeddings` since they use the same
  `DynamicPartitionsDefinition` instance), plus deletion of the stale
  `synopsis/{imdb_id}.json`, `enrichment/{imdb_id}.json`, and
  `embeddings/{imdb_id}.json` files. `delete_dynamic_partition` only
  removes the imdb_id from the active partition set — it does not delete
  historical materializations or on-disk files, so the file deletion has
  to happen explicitly. Once those files are gone, the next
  `qdrant_collection` rebuild naturally excludes that movie — there is
  nothing further to delete in Qdrant itself.

**Correction, now fixed (found 2026-07-05 during dev-subset verification,
fixed same day).** The file deletion above is invisible to Dagster's own
materialization tracking (it's a direct filesystem write, not an asset
output), so `qdrant_collection`'s `eager()` condition — which only reacts
to tracked `embeddings` updates — had no reason to fire on a pure removal.
Confirmed live: removing one of the dev-subset movies with no other movie
being added in the same cycle left its stale points in Qdrant indefinitely.
**Fix in place:** `sync_imdb_id_partitions` now also returns a `RunRequest`
for `qdrant_collection` whenever `removed_ids` is non-empty, so a pure
removal always triggers a rebuild directly rather than depending on an
unrelated future `embeddings` update. See
[Known gaps found during dev-subset verification](#known-gaps-found-during-dev-subset-verification-2026-07-05).

## Intermediate/temp storage — decided (2026-07-05)

**Per-partition flat files, not DuckDB**, for the three partitioned
stages — one JSON file per movie per stage (`synopsis/{imdb_id}.json`,
`enrichment/{imdb_id}.json`, `embeddings/{imdb_id}.json`, the last holding
each section's text alongside its embedding vector), via a custom
IOManager keyed off `context.partition_key`. DuckDB is single-writer (like
SQLite) — if these partitions run concurrently (intended, see above),
concurrent writers to one DuckDB file would hit lock contention, and
serializing them just to keep DuckDB would defeat the purpose of
partitioning for these stages.

DuckDB remains exactly as already decided for `raw_movies`/`stg_movies`
(genuinely SQL-shaped, single-writer, unpartitioned) — this only concerns
the three new per-movie partitioned stages. `qdrant_collection` reads
every `embeddings/{imdb_id}.json` on disk directly; it has no storage
concern of its own.

## Asset boundary — decided (2026-07-05)

`raw_movies` → `stg_movies` (unpartitioned, as-is) → partition-sync sensor
→ `synopsis` (partitioned by `imdb_id`) → `enrichment` (partitioned by
`imdb_id`, depends on `synopsis`) → `embeddings` (partitioned by
`imdb_id`, depends on `enrichment`) → `qdrant_collection` (**unpartitioned**,
depends on all partitions of `embeddings`).

`qdrant_collection` is deliberately not partitioned, and does not do
incremental per-movie upserts. Once a movie's data is expensive to fetch,
partitioning that fetch is what earns its keep; loading already-computed
data into Qdrant is not expensive, so the simplest correct thing —
delete all points, reinsert everything currently in `embeddings/*.json`
— is both simpler and self-correcting (a movie removed from `embeddings`
via the deletion cascade above is automatically absent from the next
rebuild, *provided a rebuild actually runs* — see the correction under
[Deletion / pruning cascade](#deletion--pruning-cascade--decided-2026-07-05)).
This is a deliberate change from the legacy code's behavior of writing to
the vector store immediately, interleaved per movie.

## Qdrant payload shape — decided (2026-07-05), fixed after a real gap

`vector-store-contract.md` requires up to 4 points per `imdb_id` (1
`synopsis` + up to 3 `enriched`), each carrying full catalog metadata
(`title`/`year`/`imdb_rating`/`content_rating`/`genres`/`thumb_url`) and an
`embedding_type` field. An initial implementation of `embeddings`/
`qdrant_collection` missed this — it only embedded the 3 enrichment
sections (no synopsis-type point at all) and wrote just `imdb_id`+`section`
as metadata, with no `embedding_type`. Caught during a docs-vs-code review,
not a design change: this was a straightforward compliance gap against an
already-agreed contract, not a new decision, so it was fixed rather than
relitigated.

**Fix, now in place:**
- `embeddings` also embeds a synopsis document (`build_synopsis_document_text`
  in `plex_ingest/lib/vector_store_contract.py`, matching plex-rag's
  `MediaItem.to_document()` field-for-field) alongside the 3 enrichment
  sections — up to 4 embedded documents per movie, keyed `"synopsis"` +
  section names.
- Catalog metadata and `embedding_type` are **not** cached in
  `embeddings/*.json` — `qdrant_collection` reads them fresh from
  `stg_movies` at rebuild time (`build_catalog_metadata`, same lib module).
  This means a catalog-only correction (e.g. a fixed title) can never go
  stale in Qdrant without needing to re-embed anything, consistent with why
  a full rebuild was chosen in the first place.
- Verified against the real Plex/Gemini/Qdrant stack for the 3-movie dev
  subset: 12 points (3 movies × 4 documents), correct `embedding_type`/
  `section`/catalog fields on each.

## Known gaps found during dev-subset verification (2026-07-05)

A follow-up session deliberately exercised three operational scenarios
against the real Plex/Gemini/Qdrant stack on the dev subset — a new movie
appearing, a movie disappearing from staging, and a prompt change forcing
a re-fetch — verifying end state directly in Qdrant after each. The happy
path (correct data ends up correctly embedded and rebuilt) works for all
three once automation is actually running. Three gaps were found in how
reliably that automation actually runs, none of them requiring a design
change — all are implementation/operational fixes against already-agreed
architecture. All three have since been fixed (2026-07-05 / 2026-07-06):

1. **Fixed. Neither sensor ran by default.** `sync_imdb_id_partitions` had
   no `default_status=dg.DefaultSensorStatus.RUNNING`, and Dagster's
   auto-generated `default_automation_condition_sensor` (which drives every
   `on_missing()`/`eager()` condition in this pipeline) also defaulted to
   `STOPPED` with nothing in this repo enabling it. On a fresh instance —
   or after any `DAGSTER_HOME` reset — the entire pipeline did nothing
   automatically until both were manually toggled on. This matched the
   prior session's note that the sensor "isn't running continuously... was
   triggered manually via a one-off script," which was a symptom of this,
   not a one-off inconvenience. **Fix applied:** `sync_imdb_id_partitions`
   now has `default_status=dg.DefaultSensorStatus.RUNNING`; the implicit
   automation sensor is replaced with an explicit
   `dg.AutomationConditionSensorDefinition(..., default_status=dg.DefaultSensorStatus.RUNNING)`,
   both defined in `sync_imdb_id_partitions.py`'s `defs` assembly.

   Side note for anyone debugging sensor status by hand: the bare
   `dagster sensor start <name>` CLI (no `-w`/`-l`) can resolve a
   *different* code-location identity than `dg dev`'s own workspace (it
   inferred `plex_ingest.definitions` from the module path, while `dg dev`
   registers the location as `plex-ingest` from `pyproject.toml`). Toggling
   via the bare CLI silently updates a phantom, unwatched instigator state.
   Toggle through the running webserver's GraphQL `startSensor` mutation
   (or the UI) instead, so it definitely targets the location the running
   daemon is actually evaluating. This remains true even with
   `default_status=RUNNING` set — that only fixes the state on a *fresh*
   instance/code location; a pre-existing STOPPED state from before the fix
   still needs a manual toggle once.

2. **Fixed (2026-07-06). `on_missing()`'s cold-start blind spot, confirmed
   deterministically via
   `plex-ingest/tests/integration/test_automation_condition_cold_start.py`.**
   The mechanism is not about `dg dev` restarts losing the automation
   cursor — `DagsterInstance.start_sensor()`/`stop_sensor()` preserve a
   sensor's existing cursor whenever any stored state already exists, and
   the daemon's own sensor-reconciliation loop reuses whatever instigator
   state row is already there, only building a fresh cursor-less one `if
   not sensor_state` (both confirmed by reading Dagster's own source, not
   inferred). The real mechanism is `evaluation_id == 0` — the literal
   very first evaluation of a freshly created automation-condition cursor.
   `on_missing()`'s expansion wraps a transient event in `since(...)`,
   whose reset condition includes `initial_evaluation()` (true only at
   evaluation_id 0). If a partition is *already* missing at that exact
   first evaluation, its `missing().newly_true()` event and the
   `initial_evaluation()` reset both fire on the *same* tick — confirmed
   (in the installed Dagster 1.13.12) that this tie resolves in favor of
   the reset, so the condition evaluates false and never becomes true
   again, since `newly_true()` only fires once per missing-transition and
   the partition never un-misses and re-misses. This reproduces even for
   the exact `eager()` example in the public
   `dagster.evaluate_automation_conditions` docstring, which claims
   `total_requested == 1` on tick 1 — in this installed version it's 0, so
   `embeddings`/`qdrant_collection` (both `eager()`) share the same
   blind spot for their own first materialization, not just
   `synopsis`/`enrichment`'s `on_missing()`. Partitions that start existing
   *after* evaluation_id 0 (i.e. the cursor already has any history) are
   unaffected — confirmed via the same test suite, and consistent with
   every "new movie added to a running pipeline" scenario already verified
   live.

   **Fix applied:** rather than working around the cursor, `synopsis` and
   `enrichment` no longer carry any `automation_condition` at all —
   `sync_imdb_id_partitions` is now their sole trigger. On every tick, for
   every currently-desired partition (not just newly-added ones), it checks
   on-disk file presence directly (`_missing_stage_assets`) and issues a
   `RunRequest` for whatever's missing, sidestepping the automation-condition
   cursor entirely rather than depending on its semantics. This also covers
   `embeddings`'s own cold-start case: if a desired partition's `embeddings`
   file is missing, the sensor also requests a `qdrant_collection` rebuild
   directly, rather than trusting `qdrant_collection`'s `eager()` to notice
   on its own. `embeddings` keeps its `eager()` condition for the ordinary
   steady-state cascade (re-embed when `enrichment` changes after a manual
   backfill) — that path reacts to `any_deps_updated`, a recurring event
   unaffected by the one-shot `missing()` bug, so it's left as-is.
   Regression tests: `test_previously_registered_partition_missing_files_still_gets_backfilled`
   (the bug directly — a partition that's neither new nor removed this tick
   but has no files) and
   `test_addition_backfills_the_new_partition_and_rebuilds_qdrant`, both in
   `tests/unit/test_sync_imdb_id_partitions.py`. Still worth raising
   upstream with Dagster, since it contradicts their own public docstring
   example.

3. **Fixed. Pure removals never triggered a `qdrant_collection` rebuild.**
   Covered above under [Deletion / pruning cascade](#deletion--pruning-cascade--decided-2026-07-05).
   **Fix applied:** `sync_imdb_id_partitions` now requests a
   `qdrant_collection` run (a `RunRequest` in the returned `SensorResult`,
   alongside the existing `dynamic_partitions_requests`) whenever
   `removed_ids` is non-empty, instead of relying on an incidental future
   `embeddings` update to clean up stale Qdrant points. Covered by a
   regression test (`test_removal_requests_a_qdrant_collection_rebuild` in
   `tests/unit/test_sync_imdb_id_partitions.py`).

All three gaps are now fixed. Reproduction detail for all three is in the
handoff doc this section was originally written from, though its framing
of #2 as a restart issue has since been superseded by the test-confirmed
mechanism above.

## Frameworks under consideration

- **LlamaIndex** — for document splitting and/or enrichment. Would
  potentially replace or supplement hand-rolled chunking logic.
- **LangChain** — for abstraction over LLM calls and Qdrant interaction.
  `plex-rag` already depends on `langchain-google-genai` and
  `langchain-qdrant`; open question is whether `plex-ingest` reuses the
  same abstractions (consistency, shared idioms) or writes directly against
  `qdrant-client` (fewer dependencies, more control) — see the epic's
  decision to keep this a docs-only contract, not a shared code package.

Per the `dagster-expert` skill's integration workflow, whichever of these
get adopted should go through `dg list components` / `dagster-dbt` etc.
rather than hand-rolled wrappers, where a Dagster component exists for the
tool.

**Sling and dlt — decided against for the Plex extraction step (2026-07-05):**
see [Decisions made so far](#decisions-made-so-far) below. Both remain
theoretically open for later stages (scrape/enrich) but neither has an
obvious fit there either — scraping is browser automation, not EL, and
enrichment is LLM generation, not EL. Don't force-fit either tool onto a
stage it wasn't designed for; revisit only if a stage's shape actually
matches what they're for (structured extract-load).

## Decisions made so far

Resolved during phase 2 work (2026-07-05) — kept here rather than promoted
to the epic's decision log since these are asset-level tooling calls, not
epic-wide architectural pillars. Implementation-level detail (exact
versions, error messages, code structure) intentionally lives in
`plex-ingest`'s own `CLAUDE.md` and code comments, not duplicated here —
this section only records *what* was decided and *why*, for scanning.

- **`raw_movies`** (Plex → DuckDB): full overwrite every run, no
  partitioning. Measured directly: 156 movies, ~3s end to end — cheap
  enough that re-fetching beats incremental-sync complexity.
- **Sling: ruled out for Plex extraction, no path at all** — its connector
  model (DB/file/object-storage) has no support for arbitrary Python/SDK
  sources like `plexapi`, confirmed via official docs.
- **dlt: ruled out for `raw_movies` specifically, not forever** — it can
  wrap custom Python/SDK sources, but its schema-evolution/incremental-cursor
  machinery isn't needed for a small, fixed-schema, full-overwrite asset.
  Revisit if incremental Plex sync becomes necessary, or a real paginated
  REST API source (TMDB/OMDB) is added later.
- **`dagster_duckdb.DuckDBResource` adopted** over the original hand-rolled
  version — same interface, plus Dagster's own retry/backoff on lock
  contention, no extra dependency cost. See `plex-ingest/src/plex_ingest/defs/resources/duckdb.py`.
- **dbt adopted for the staging transform** (`stg_movies`) — resolving
  `imdb_id` out of Plex's raw `guids` is genuinely SQL-shaped, and
  `imdb_id` is the whole system's primary key, so dbt's `not_null`/`unique`
  tests are a real data-quality gate. Wired via `dagster_dbt.DbtProjectComponent`
  with automatic lineage from `raw_movies`. See
  `plex-ingest/dbt_project/models/staging/`.
- **`plex-ingest` pinned to Python 3.13, not 3.14** — forced by dbt
  adoption (`dbt-core` doesn't import on 3.14). See "Environment gotchas"
  in `plex-ingest/CLAUDE.md` before ever considering bumping this.
- **`plex-ingest`'s mypy pre-commit hook pinned to `mypy==1.9.0`** — a
  `pathspec` version conflict with `dbt-core`. Also documented in
  `plex-ingest/CLAUDE.md`.

## Working notes

- Default to the `dagster-expert` plugin/skill for any Dagster-specific
  work in this project (asset patterns, `dg` CLI usage, component
  selection) to keep the project consistent with Dagster conventions.
- Update this doc as questions get resolved — move settled decisions into
  the epic's [README.md decision log](README.md#decisions-made) rather than
  leaving them here once they're no longer open.
